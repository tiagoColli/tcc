**What is a feature store and how can it help me ?**

A feature store is a place for storing data that will be consumed by models during the training, validation and in production.

Will's Feature Store aims to facilitate the work of the data scientist in their day-to-day lives through the abstraction of the data extraction stage of a database and the pre-processing stage. Tha data is unloaded, pre-processed and saved to an S3 bucket. With Apache Airflow, this task becomes transparent and recurrent, i.e. the data scientist can have the latest data at hand processed whenever they need it.
